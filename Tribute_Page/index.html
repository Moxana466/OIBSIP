      <h2>About Franz Kafka</h2>
      <p>
        Franz Kafka (1883–1924) was a German-speaking Bohemian writer widely regarded as one of the most influential authors of the 20th century. 
        His works often explore themes of alienation, absurdity, and the struggle of the individual in a bureaucratic world. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Though much of his work was published posthumously, including <em>The Trial</em>, <em>The Castle</em>, and <em>Amerika</em>, 
        Kafka’s unique style and haunting imagination have left a lasting impact on modern literature, philosophy, and art.
